# Stock Data Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python script for extracting data from yahoofinance. We will use Python to analyze historical stock price data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The goal is to gain insights into stock price trends, volatility, and potentially identify investment opportunities.

## Project Overview

- **Import Libraries:** We will start by importing necessary Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `yfinance` to handle data and interact with Yahoo Finance.

- **Choose Ticker(s):** Select the stock ticker symbol(s) you want to analyze, for instance, "NG, SSE, HISCOX" for 
  National Grid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Inc and Hiscox LTD

- **Download Historical Data:** Using the `yfinance` library, download historical stock price data for the chosen ticker(s). Then, specify the time period and frequency.

- **Data Cleaning:** Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring it's in a usable format, e.g removing rows

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to understand the data better. Calculate summary statistics, visualize trends, and identify patterns.

- **Calculate Returns:** Calculate daily or periodical returns of the stock prices, which are crucial for financial analyses.

- **Moving Averages and Trends :** Determine moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day) to identify trends and potential crossovers.

- **Volatility Analysis:** Analyze stock volatility using metrics like standard deviation to gain insights into risk and price movements.

- **Correlation and Portfolio Analysis (Optional):** Calculate correlations between returns of multiple stocks for portfolio diversification strategies.

- **Visualization:** Create visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to graphically represent findings.
